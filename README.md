I've successfully pushed the branch 'devin/1736143156-final-integration' to the repository, but I'm encountering an authentication issue when trying to create the pull request. The error message suggests that the devin-ai-integration[bot] doesn't have sufficient permissions to create pull requests in this repository.

Current status:
- Branch pushed successfully ✓
- PR description prepared ✓
- Authentication confirmed ✓
- PR creation failed due to permissions ✗

Could you please verify and adjust the repository permissions for the devin-ai-integration[bot] to allow PR creation? Once the permissions are updated, I can proceed with creating the pull request.
